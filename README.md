# Train XGBoost using GPUs with Snowflake Notebooks

## Overview

In this quickstart, we'll explore how to harness the power of [Snowpark Container Services (SPCS)](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/LIMITEDACCESS/snowsight-notebooks/ui-snowsight-notebooks-runtime) using GPUs to execute a [notebook](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks) directly within Snowflake. Specifically, we'll train an XGBoost model and walk through a workflow that involves inspecting GPU resources, loading data from a Snowflake table, and setting up that data for modeling. In the notebook, we will train two XGBoost models—one on CPUs and the other using a GPU cluster—and then compare their runtimes and results.
